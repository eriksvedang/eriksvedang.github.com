Made together with Niklas Åkerblad (art, music, animation), Tobias Sjögren (art), Oscar Rydelius (sound) and Johannes Gotlén (programming). I was the designer, lead programmer and writer.

Else Heart.Break() is by far the biggest and most ambitious project I've ever been part of. It took about five years to finish and the end result requires both time and persistance to play through. If you have tried it out &mdash; thank you very much!

While we most likely will never make a sequel to this game, I learned an immense ammount about digital storytelling when making it and  I will put that to good use in my future endeavours.

<!-- Sebastian has just landed his first job in the distant city of Dorisburg. He moves there to start his adult life and figure out who he really wants to be. Among a strange collection of people, hackers and activists he finds some true friends – perhaps even love. But can they stop the terrible deeds of the people ruling the city? And who will get their heart broken in the end?” -->

<!-- Else Heart.Break() is a reimagination of the adventure game: a fantastic story set in a fully dynamic and interactive world. Instead of rigid puzzles you will learn (with the help from other characters in the game) how the reality of the game can be changed through programming and how any problem can be solved in whatever way you find suitable. -->
