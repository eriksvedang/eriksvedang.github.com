Have you been waiting for a game that is catering to the iPad’s unique strengths as a beautiful social gaming platform of the future?
Wait no more! Shot Shot Shoot represents a new way of playing games with your friends, combining the magic of computers with the special interactions made possible by board games.

The goal of the game is simple: destroy the five squares on the opponent’s side of the board. Maneuver single shots with high precision or overwhelm the other player with massive attack waves — a mixture of fast-paced gameplay and deep strategy that everyone seems to love.
