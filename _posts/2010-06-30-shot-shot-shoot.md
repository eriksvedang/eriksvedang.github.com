Shot Shot Shoot was designed when the first iPad came out. It's a local multiplayer game for two players that plays to the strengths of the unique tablet form factor. The goal of the game is simple: destroy the five squares on the opponentâ€™s side of the board. Maneuver single shots with high precision or overwhelm the other player with massive attack waves &mdash; Shot Shot Shoot is a mixture of fast-paced gameplay and deep strategy.
