Slice & Dice is a minimalistic card game designed by me with illustrations by Nicolai Troshinsky. Over the span of five rounds the players build up their troops and fighting power to win treasure in battle. With just two decks of cards and some dice this game is packing strategic and novel gameplay into quite a small box.

The game is for two players and takes about 30 – 45 minutes to play.

We’re currently looking for a publisher for the game, contact me if you can help.

These prototypes have been printed by the awesome site The Game Crafter that lets anyone make and print their own board games. I highly recommend them!
