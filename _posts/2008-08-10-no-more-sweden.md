No More Sweden is a gathering of independent game developers from the whole world meeting up somewhere in Sweden, making games and partying for a weekend.

The event has been run by me and Martin Jonasson ([@grapefrukt](https://twitter.com/grapefrukt)) since 2008. Read more about it at [www.nomoresweden.com](http://www.nomoresweden.com).
