Dmrsion is a game about fluctuating dimensions of time and space, represented by pieces of art throughout history.

It is a very quick game for 2 – 4 players, packing a lot of depth and replayability into a single 50 card deck. Matches take only about 5 – 10 minutes and almost every card is unique, leading to very different situations every time you play. The rules are so simple they fit on a single card, yet the intricate interactions between all the cards lead to very strategic gameplay with many interesting choices. The game can also be played in pairs, 2 vs 2.

I'm currently looking for a publisher who can bring this game out to the wider public. Please get [in touch](/contact) if you can help out with that!
