The colorful and party-inclined cousin of Shot Shot Shoot. Made together with [Shelby Cinca](https://twitter.com/catbeatsmusic), adding several elements to the gameplay (powerups, legion mode) while preserving its strategical depth and reliance on reflexes. In fact &mdash; Tri Tri Triobelisk is even faster than the original Shot Shot Shoot. It also contains an album worth of songs by [Triobelisk](https://triobelisk.bandcamp.com).
