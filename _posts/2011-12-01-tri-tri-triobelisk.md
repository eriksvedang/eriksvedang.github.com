The colorful and party-inclined cousin of Shot Shot Shoot. Made together with [Shelby Cinca](https://twitter.com/catbeatsmusic), adding several elements to the gameplay (powerups, legion mode) while preserving its strategical depth and reliance on reflexes. In fact &mdash; Tri Tri Triobelisk is even faster than the original Shot Shot Shoot. It also contains an album worth of songs by Triobelisk.

Currently unavailable from the AppStore but will be re-released in 2018 for modern Apple devices.
