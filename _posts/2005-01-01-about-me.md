<!-- I was born in 1986 in Uppsala (Sweden) where my parents were studying at the university. Early on we moved to the countryside to live in a tiny red cottage until I had three smaller siblings. We got our milk directly from the local farmer and I roamed freely in the huge forests surrounding us. -->

<!-- When I was 12 we moved to the west coast of Sweden, to a house right next to the archipelago Gullmarn. My teenage years were mostly spent trying out a lot of different art forms, like music, game development (yay for Klik 'n Play!), drawing and close-up magic. My biggest passion at the time was film making. During the years 2002 - 2005 (together with my friends and family) produced a lot of short movies in almost all different genres. -->

<!-- After finishing high-school I moved to SkÃ¶vde to study game design at the university there. I had an absolute blast and after graduating I started teaching game design at the same program. I worked at the game development program for 1,5 years until my successes with Blueberry Garden enabled me to quit my job and start working full time on my own games. -->
