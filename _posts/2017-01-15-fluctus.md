A two-player platform brawler where you try to shoot the other dude with your gun. The only catch is that your gun shoots waveforms instead of in a straight line (the wave form can also be adjusted by picking up powerups, i.e. to make it oscillate more frequently).

Made together with Fabian SÃ¶rensson during the Global Game Jam 2017. I coded the gun and the waveforms, he did everything else.
