A two-player platform brawler where you try to shoot the other dude with your gun. The only catch is that your gun shoots waveforms instead of in a straight line (the wave form can also be adjusted by picking up powerups, i.e. to make it oscillate more frequently).

This was a collaboration with Fabian SÃ¶rensson during the Global Game Jam 2017. I coded the gun and the waveforms, he did everything else. We used the fantasy console [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) to make it which was great fun. If you're a bit burnt out by big clunky tools (or is just starting out with game making) you should really give it a shot.
