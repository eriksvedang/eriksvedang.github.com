Stomp is a prototype I made based on the idea of a card game played in real-time, removing the need to wait for your opponent to make their move. You can try it out over at itch.io (link above).

I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and some people really love it. Unfortunately the current version is also fairly inaccessible and hard to understand. Hopefully I can find the time to make a better and more easy-to-play version of the same idea some time in the future...
