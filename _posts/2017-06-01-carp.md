Born out of frustration with current tools for digital game making &mdash; and a love for the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) family of languages &mdash; I invented Carp. It's a programming language designed with game making in mind, focused on speed and predictable performance. Also, it has the kind of tooling and syntax that I prefer. Hopefully it will make me and others feel a little bit better while programming.

The first version of the compiler was made 2015 - 2016, attracting a fair bit of attention in the programming community. In the spring of 2017 I rebooted the project, rewriting it in Haskell (it used to be C). The project is open source and available for your viewing at [Github](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp). There you can also find documentation explaining how to use the language, and a link to our chat group on gitter.im where you can ask questions and talk to the people involved.
