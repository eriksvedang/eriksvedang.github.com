Born out of frustration with current tools for digital game making &mdash; and a love for the Lisp family of languages &mdash; I invented Carp. It's a programming language designed with game making in mind, focusing on speed and predictable performance. Also, it has the kind of tooling and syntax that I prefer.

The first version of the compiler was made 2015 - 2016 and in the spring of 2017 I rebooted the project, rewriting it in Haskell (it used to be C). The project is open source and can be found at [https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp](https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp). There you will find documentation explaining how to use the language, and also a link to our chat group on gitter.im where you can ask questions and talk to the people involved.
