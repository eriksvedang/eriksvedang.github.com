My big interest in board games and their history led me to run a study circle on this topic. We gathered one night a week and played various board and card games from around the world, both new and old. Pictures and details on the games can be found at the following blog: [http://speldesigncirkeln.tumblr.com](http://speldesigncirkeln.tumblr.com). Hopefully I will have time to do a second run soon again. Get in touch if you're interested in participating!
