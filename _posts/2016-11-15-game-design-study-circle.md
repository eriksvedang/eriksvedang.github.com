My big interest in board games and their history inspired me to run a study circle on the topic.

We gathered one night a week for eight weeks and played various board and card games from around the world, both new and old. Pictures and details about the games (in English) can be found on [this blog](http://speldesigncirkeln.tumblr.com).

Hopefully I will have time to do a second run soon again. [Get in touch](/contact) if you're interested in participating!
