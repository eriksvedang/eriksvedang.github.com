An [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga)-inspired space shooter made together with [Ossian Bor√©n](http://ossianboren.com) during the Banana Jam 2017. He programmed and designed most of the game, I just made the enemies (art + movement).

We used the fantasy console [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) to make it, which was great fun. If you're a bit burnt out by big clunky tools (or is just starting out with game making) you should really give it a shot.

The final game was displayed in an arcade cabinet made out of cardboard banana boxes. Thanks a lot to [Erik Einebrant](https://twitter.com/z3zard) for helping out with that!
