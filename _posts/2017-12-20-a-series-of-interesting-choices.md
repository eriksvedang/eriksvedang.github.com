In the fall of 2018 I participated in a course called "Pedagogical Game Design". Our final assignment was to make an educational game, and I &mdash; at the time teaching game design at the University of Sk√∂vde &mdash; thought it would be a good idea to make a game about designing games. The result was "A Series of Interesting Choices" (named after a quote by Sid Meier). It was inspired by games like [Dixit](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit) and [Balderdash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash) except that instead of coming up with pictures or words you design your own game. While this might sound overly complicated and hard, it's actually very fun in practice.

Check out the official site for more information, rules, and (soon) a way to order a physical copy of the game.
