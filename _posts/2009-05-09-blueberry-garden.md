Blueberry Garden is a short experimental game about curiosity and exploration. You take on the role of a creature investigating a mysterious world to find out what is going on there. It’s probably not very much like anything you’ve played before but I hope you will find it enjoyable!

Awarded with IGF:s Seamus mcNally Grand Prize 2009.

You can buy it from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/29160/).
