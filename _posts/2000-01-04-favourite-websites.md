*This essay contains my recommendations for surfing the internet.*

I'm a big fan of the oldschool kind of homepage &mdash; a personal and self-made collection of static pages with lots of little nooks and cranies to explore. One excellent site with excactly those properites is the one of [David Parlett](http://www.parlettgames.uk), renowed games scholar and designer. If you have any interest in board or card games you *must* explore his material! Related but of a more encyclopedic nature is [Pagat](https://www.pagat.com), a handcrafted database of card games from all over the world.

Another great collection of pages are those of [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com). He has ideas for how to improve math education, user interfaces, and more. His visionary talks for how software development really should work took the programming world by storm back in 2013 (?), be sure to check that out if you're interested.

When on the topic of programming and math &mdash; [this video series on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc) is really cool and accessible. If longing for something less serious the [Math with Bad Drawings blog](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com) is also pretty fun.

For those who plan on travelling the long and winding road that is game programming, the free web book [Patterns of game programming](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html) is a good read. The author's new article series on [how to implement a programming language](http://craftinginterpreters.com) is just as clear and enthusiastic. If that sounds like a nice way to spend your time, you definitely should read [the best programming book ever written](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html). Be warned though, this is a deep rabbit hole that you might never escape. Perhaps you will make something slightly [esoteric](http://esoteric.codes).

In my practice of designing board games, the site [Game Crafter](https://thegamecrafter.com) has been of tremendous value for producing near-professional looking prototypes. For more general game parts like tokens and blank cards I've also enjoyed placing big orders with the German specialist [spielmaterial.de](http://spielmaterial.de). Speaking of board games and craft, these [hand made games from Crete](https://tetraktis-studio.gr/en/portfolio-item/board-game/) are really inspiring and I hope to acquire some one day...
